# Rock Paper Scissors

Just the basic rock, paper, scissors game that keeps track of the score and determines the winner.
The winner is the first player to reach 3 points.
The computer pick on a random one of the 3 choices every turn.
If the player enters something other than rock, paper or scissors he is met with the text (Enter valid choice!!!).
If you spell on the of the 3 choices with upper or lower cases, they are going to be converted to lower cases anyways.
