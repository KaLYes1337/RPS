# Rock Paper Scissors

Just the basic rock, paper, scissors game that keeps track of the score. <br/>
The winner is the first player to reach the required points.<br/>
Required points for win are determined by dividing the number of games, you wish to play, by 2 and rounding the result to the next closes whole number.<br/>
The computer pick on a random one of the 3 choices every turn.<br/>
If the player enters something other than rock, paper or scissors he is met with the text (Enter valid choice!!!) until he enters the correct word.<br/>
If you spell one the of the 3 choices with upper or lower cases, they are going to be converted to lower cases anyways.<br/>
