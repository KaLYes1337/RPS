# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock, paper, scissors game that keeps track of the score and games played. <br/>
The winner is the first player to reach the required points.<br/>
The required points for a win are determined by dividing the number of games, you wish to play, by 2 and rounding the result to the next closes whole number. If you exceed the original number of games you wished to play, but there is no winner, the game will continue until either you or the PC wins.<br/>
The computer pick on a random one of the 3 choices every turn.<br/>
If the player enters something other than rock, paper or scissors he is met with the text (Enter valid choice!!!) until he enters the correct word.<br/>
If you spell one the of the 3 choices with upper or lower cases, they are going to be converted to lower cases anyways.<br/>
